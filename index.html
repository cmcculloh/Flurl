What???

Yeah. So, what the heck is up with this page? A unicorn? A rainbow? Has this guy lost his mind?

Maybe. But that's beside the point...

When I saw the panda with the rainbow coming out of it's mouth I immediately thought of the
currently inescapably (in the jQuery community) unicorn meme (which at first I must admit I
hated). I had visions of Jonathan Neal's "You Dream You're A Unicorn" playing while a rainbow 
scrolled past a unicorn and flickr images tumbled down the screen. I immediately rejected the 
idea because it's... stupid... But then I realized what a better way to showcase HTML 5 and CSS 3 
than to have a CSS only animation and an HTML 5 media player both present on the page? Plus I 
could use a cool font. Plus it's memorable, I mean, who else is going to have done anything like 
it? Plus, when I'm done, even if nothing else comes of the whole interview process, I'll at least 
have something ridiculous for my blog. Win, win, win, win! Plus, hopefully I made someone along
the way at least chuckle.
